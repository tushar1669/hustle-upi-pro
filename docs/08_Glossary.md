# HustleHub MVP - Glossary

## Business and Domain Terms

### Payment and Financial Terms

**UPI VPA (Virtual Payment Address)**
Unified Payments Interface address used for digital payments in India. Format: `username@bank` (e.g., `freelancer@paytm`, `acme@googlepay`). In HustleHub, both clients and global settings can have UPI VPAs, with client-specific VPAs taking priority on invoices for personalized payment collection.

**UTR (Unique Transaction Reference)**
12-digit alphanumeric code generated by Indian banks for each digital transaction. Used to track and verify payments. Format examples: `UTR123456789`, `UTR-QA-1`. In HustleHub, clients provide UTR when marking invoices as paid for bank verification and record-keeping.

**GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number)**
15-character alphanumeric code for GST registration in India. Format: `27ABCDE1234F1Z5` where:
- First 2 digits: State code
- Next 10 characters: PAN-based unique identifier  
- 13th character: Registration number
- 14th character: Z (default)
- 15th character: Check digit

**GST (Goods and Services Tax)**
Indirect tax system in India. HustleHub defaults to 18% GST rate (configurable in settings). Applied as: `gst_amount = subtotal × (gst_percent / 100)`, `total = subtotal + gst_amount`.

### Invoice Lifecycle

**Invoice Status Flow**
Defined progression of invoice states:
- **draft**: Created but not sent to client; editable; no reminders scheduled
- **sent**: Delivered to client, payment pending; triggers 3 automatic reminders
- **paid**: Payment received and recorded; no further action needed
- **overdue**: Past due date without payment; continues reminder schedule

**Invoice Number Format**
Standardized numbering: `{prefix}-{year}-{sequence}` (e.g., `HH-2025-1003`)
- prefix: Configurable business identifier (default: "HH")
- year: 4-digit current year
- sequence: 4-digit auto-incrementing number (0001, 0002, etc.)

**Reminder Cadence**
Automated follow-up schedule for sent invoices:
- **+3 days**: First gentle reminder after issue date
- **+7 days**: Second follow-up reminder
- **+14 days**: Final reminder before escalation
Each reminder can be sent via WhatsApp, email, or manual notification.

**Line Items (Invoice Items)**
Individual billable components within an invoice:
- **title**: Description of service/product
- **qty**: Quantity delivered
- **rate**: Price per unit
- **amount**: Total for line item (qty × rate)
Multiple line items combine to form invoice subtotal.

### Task and Project Management

**Billable Task**
Task marked as chargeable to client with defined hourly rate. When completed, can automatically generate invoice draft with task details as line items. Billable tasks require:
- Associated project (preferred) or client
- Hourly rate definition
- Time tracking capability

**Project Billability**
Default setting determining if tasks under a project are chargeable by default. Affects:
- New task creation (inherits project billing setting)
- Invoice generation workflows
- Time tracking and reporting

**Task Status Progression**
Defined lifecycle for task management:
- **open**: Newly created, ready to start work
- **in_progress**: Currently being worked on
- **done**: Completed (triggers billable invoice prompt if applicable)
- **cancelled**: No longer needed or abandoned

**Task-to-Invoice Conversion**
Automated workflow for billable tasks:
1. Complete billable task (mark as 'done')
2. System prompts: "Create invoice for this task?"
3. If confirmed → Opens invoice creation with:
   - Task client pre-selected
   - Task project pre-selected
   - Task title as first invoice item
   - Estimated amount based on hours and rate

### Client and Communication

## Technical and System Terms

### Architecture Components

**Collections API**
Data access abstraction layer wrapping Supabase operations. Provides:
- Consistent error handling across database operations
- TypeScript type safety for all data interactions
- Reusable functions for common operations (e.g., `clients_all()`, `create_invoice()`)
- Integration point for React Query caching

**PostgREST**
Supabase's RESTful API layer that automatically generates endpoints from PostgreSQL schema. Enables:
- CRUD operations via HTTP requests
- Real-time subscriptions to data changes
- Automatic API documentation
- Direct database access through web standards

**React Query Cache Keys**
Identifiers for cached data enabling efficient state management:
```typescript
CACHE_KEYS = {
  INVOICES: ['invoices_all'],
  DASHBOARD: ['v_dashboard_metrics'],
  CLIENTS: ['clients_all']
}
```
Used for cache invalidation when data changes, ensuring UI consistency.

**RLS (Row Level Security)**
PostgreSQL feature enabling access control at the row level. Current state:
- **MVP**: Permissive policies allowing all access (`USING (true)`)
- **Future**: User-specific policies (`USING (auth.uid() = owner_id)`)
- **Migration**: Ready for authentication-based access control

### Database and Data Management

**owner_id Field**
UUID field present in all tables for future multi-user support:
- Currently NULL in MVP (single-user mode)
- Will contain `auth.uid()` when authentication enabled
- Enables user-specific data isolation via RLS policies

**Enum Types**
PostgreSQL custom types ensuring data consistency:
- `invoice_status`: 'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue'
- `task_status`: 'open', 'in_progress', 'done', 'cancelled'
- `reminder_status`: 'pending', 'sent', 'failed'
- `notification_channel`: 'whatsapp', 'email', 'manual'

**v_dashboard_metrics**
PostgreSQL view providing aggregated KPI data:
- `this_month_paid`: Sum of paid invoices in current month
- `overdue_amount`: Total outstanding past due date
- `tasks_due_7d`: Count of tasks due within 7 days
Optimized for dashboard performance with proper indexing.

**Cache Invalidation**
Process of clearing stale React Query cache when data changes:
- Triggered automatically after mutations
- Ensures real-time UI updates
- Follows patterns like: invoice changes → invalidate INVOICES + DASHBOARD + MESSAGES

### Quality Assurance and Testing

**QA Harness**
Comprehensive automated testing system with three components:
- **Classic QA (14 tests)**: Core business logic validation
